Coding style
------------
bzr-git tries to follow PEP-8 where possible. docstrings should use 
restructuredText.

Testing
-------
The aim is to have unit tests for all functionality: If you add functionality
please provide matching tests. If you fix a bug, it would be nice if you could
add a test that reproduces the bug (so that we can prevent regressions).
