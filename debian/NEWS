bzr-builddeb (2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  There have been several compatibility breaks in this release.

  * builddeb now looks for .orig.tar.gz files in the parent
    directory of the branch when needed, but still falls back
    to ../tarballs for compatibility. It will also place
    the result of the build in the parent dir if it can find it.
    This is to make it resemble dpkg-buildpackage more.
  * import-dsc --snapshot has been removed, as snapshot.debian.net
    is nearly useless at the moment. It can be ressurected later
    if needed.
  * The command line options of merge-upstream and import-dsc
    have been overhauled. It shouldn't be possible to
    break anything by using the same arguments as before.

  --working-tree is no longer needed, as the default is now to use the
  working tree. If you want the old behaviour then please use -r-1. This
  also means that --ignore-changes and the like have no effect.

  None of the options are removed or deprecated yet. That will be done in a
  later release.
