bzr-builddeb (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * From this version onwards use of .bzr-builddeb/local.conf is deprecated,
    as it is incompatible with proposed changes to better integrate builddeb
    with the rest of bzr and support building remote branches. Please move the
    contents of .bzr-builddeb/local.conf to .bzr/branch/branch.conf. You can
    then delete the former, and remove any mention from .bzrignore.
    
    For compatibility the file will still be read and the values used for
    this release, but starting from 0.18 the file will be ignored.
