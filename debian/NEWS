bzr-builddeb (2.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The build command now defaults to "debuild" instead of
    "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us". The most obvious change here will be
    that it tries to sign packages by default.

  * The tags that were used for tracking versions have changed format. The
    old format caused bugs, so this had to be done, but it does cause issues
    for existing branches. To migrate you can rename the tags:
    - debian-<version> or ubuntu-<version> simply become <version>
    - upstream-debian-<version> or upstream-ubuntu-<version> become
      upstream-<version>

  * export-upstream in normal mode has been deprected in favour of using
    merge-upstream.  Where you once used export-upstream to export the tarball
    to build against then now use merge-upstream against the branch to merge
    the code. pristine-tar integration will then ensure the tarball is available
    at build time, without the problems that export-upstream had. If the
    merge-upstream does not give any conflicts then you can commit and test-build.

bzr-builddeb (2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  There have been several compatibility breaks in this release.

  * builddeb now looks for .orig.tar.gz files in the parent
    directory of the branch when needed, but still falls back
    to ../tarballs for compatibility. It will also place
    the result of the build in the parent dir if it can find it.
    This is to make it resemble dpkg-buildpackage more.
  * import-dsc --snapshot has been removed, as snapshot.debian.net
    is nearly useless at the moment. It can be ressurected later
    if needed.
  * The command line options of merge-upstream and import-dsc
    have been overhauled. It shouldn't be possible to
    break anything by using the same arguments as before.

bzr-builddeb (0.91) unstable; urgency=low

  --working-tree is no longer needed, as the default is now to use the
  working tree. If you want the old behaviour then please use -r-1. This
  also means that --ignore-changes and the like have no effect.

  None of the options are removed or deprecated yet. That will be done in a
  later release.
