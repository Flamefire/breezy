bzr-builddeb (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compatible with bzr 0.14.
  * Drop the silly restriction on only invoking the command from the root
    of a branch.
  * Add support for non-native full source packages. To do this, just
    have orig-dir pointing to the dir containing the upstream tarballs.
    This involves a change in behaviour I am afraid. Native packages are
    now not the default, so if you have one echo 'native = True' to
    global.conf.
