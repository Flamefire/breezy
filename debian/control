Description: easy to use distributed version control system
 Breezy is a distributed version control system designed to be easy to
 use and intuitive, able to adapt to many workflows, reliable, and
 easily extendable.
 .
 Publishing of branches can be done over plain HTTP, that is, no special
 software is needed on the server to host Breezy branches. Branches can
 be pushed to the server via sftp (which most SSH installations come
 with), FTP, or over a custom and faster protocol if brz is installed in
 the remote end.
 .
 Merging in Breezy is easy, as the implementation is able to avoid many
 spurious conflicts, deals well with repeated merges between branches,
 and is able to handle modifications to renamed files correctly.
 .
 Install python-paramiko if you are going to push branches to remote
 hosts with sftp.
