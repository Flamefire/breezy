- svn2bzr: use commitbuilder so there's no need for workingtrees? 
  Use more mapping functions.
- use svn.ra.checkout() rather than individial get_file() and get_dir() 
  calls
- bug 44312
- more tests
- support for 'svn:ignore' -> maps to .bzrignore. Generated from the 'svn:ignore' properties on each directory, sorted alphabetically.
- support tracking of moves. SVN does not support moves or renames, but only copies. This means in order to see whether a file was renamed, there needs to be a check to see if that file was only copied once and the original was removed. 
- support pushing to SVN branches. Push as merged.
- support creating working trees
