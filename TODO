- simplify find_branches by using Transport.list_dir() ?
- make scheme name part of revision id
- fix commits in heavyweight checkouts somehow
- fix autorealm repository
- handle parent directories of branches being moved correctly
- faster "bzr status" in lightweight checkouts
- when committing specific files in a lightweight checkout, make sure to 
  commit the right file id changes for "."
- custom implementation of WorkingTree.revert()
- don't update all entries to the same revnum when opening working tree
- avoid extra connect in logwalker?
- get rid of use of `svn ls' in logwalker
- make ListBranchingScheme() support wildcards
 - rewrite TrunkBranchingScheme() and ListBranchingScheme() as subclasses of 
   ListBranchingScheme()
- support multiple branching schemes per repository
- more efficient implementation for applying txdeltas to weaves. perhaps convert svn deltas to bzr deltas?
- free memory!
- implement BzrDirFormat.get_converter()
