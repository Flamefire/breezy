- support for tags (once it is in bzrs core)
- support nested branches (svn:externals)
- use commitbuilder so there's no need for workingtrees?
- use svn.ra.checkout() rather than individial get_file() and get_dir() 
  calls
- bug 44312
- more tests
 - testsuite that generates a working tree from each revision in a .svndump file  by using just SVN tools and then compares that working tree by checking out the same revision generated by svn2bzr. Perhaps do comparisons by simply running 'svn status' ?
