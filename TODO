- simplify find_branches by using Transport.list_dir() ?
- fix autorealm repository
- avoid extra connect in logwalker?
- make ListBranchingScheme() support wildcards
- free memory!
- implement BzrDirFormat.get_converter()
- report changes to delta editor in Branch.pull()
- more blackbox tests
- split fetch tests out of test_repos
- integrate bzr:merge into bzr:revision-info or rename to bzr:merge-vXXYY ?
- cache per-repository branching scheme

Working trees:
- custom implementation of WorkingTree.revert() / WorkingTree.merge()
- add tests for objects returned by WorkingTree.pull(), Branch.pull()
- what happened to WorkingTree.add() ?
- don't update all entries to the same revnum when opening working tree
- when committing specific files in a lightweight checkout, make sure to 
  also commit the file property changes for the tree root (except 
  for pending merges).														   
- faster "bzr status" in lightweight checkouts
