- support for repositories
- support for tags (once it is in bzrs core)
- support nested branches (svn:externals)
- abandon use of obsolete functions (use BzrDir rather then Branch ?)
- more tests
 - testsuite that generates a working tree from each revision in a .svndump file  by using just SVN tools and then compares that working tree by checking out the same revision generated by svn2bzr. Perhaps do comparisons by simply running 'svn status' ?
