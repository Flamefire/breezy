- create new package

- record a version

- make --merge work with different layouts of upstream tarballs. -- Works? 
    Need some examples of strange layouts.

- import of NMU diffs

- WRITE SOME MORE TESTS

- Check whether epochs are handled sanely, especially in import-dsc and
merge-upstream.

- Need tests for the following things:
  - default result dir not being used if the builder puts the files
    somewhere else so that the build doesn't fail.
  - Falling back to ../tarballs if .. doesn't have what we need.
  - Moving a source result.
  - .changes files for packages with an epoch.
