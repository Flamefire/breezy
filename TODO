- create new package

- record a version

- migrate from arch-buildpackage?  use baz-import?

- make --merge work with different layouts of upstream tarballs. -- Works? 
    Need some examples of strange layouts.

- import of NMU diffs

- WRITE SOME MORE TESTS

- Add tagging packages, or at least a reminder to tag packages. Maybe with 
    dput/dupload as well.

- New changelog stanza command for after tagging.

- Check whether epochs are handled sanely, especially in import-dsc and
merge-upstream.

- Need tests for the following things:
  - default result dir not being used if the builder puts the files
    somewhere else so that the build doesn't fail.
  - Falling back to ../tarballs if .. doesn't have what we need.
