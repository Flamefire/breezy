mandatory before 0.4.0:
- integrate bzr:merge into bzr:revision-info or rename to bzr:merge-vXXYY
- splittree support
- nestedtree support

todo:
- more intelligent guessing of branching scheme. Look at directory structure in current tree?
- be able to create new branches
- make has_revision() more efficient - just call logwalker.touches_path() ?
- fix autorealm repository
- avoid extra connect in logwalker?
- free memory!
- report changes to delta editor in Branch.pull()
- more blackbox tests
 - svn-import without scheme specified should guess
- transform file ids in workingtree in svn-upgrade

working trees:
- implement apply_inventory_delta()
- add tests for objects returned by WorkingTree.pull(), Branch.pull()
- don't update all entries to the same revnum when opening working tree
- when committing specific files in a lightweight checkout, make sure to 
  also commit the file property changes for the tree root
- faster "bzr status"
