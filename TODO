- make scheme name part of revision id
- fix commits in heavyweight checkouts somehow
- fix autorealm repository
- handle parent directories of branches being moved correctly
- faster "bzr status" in lightweight checkouts
- don't update to the same revnum when opening working tree
- avoid extra connect in logwalker?
- get rid of use of `svn ls' in logwalker
- make ListBranchingScheme() support wildcards
 - rewrite TrunkBranchingScheme() and ListBranchingScheme() as subclasses of 
   ListBranchingScheme()
- support multiple branching schemes per repository
- more efficient implementation for applying txdeltas to weaves. perhaps convert svn deltas to bzr deltas?
- free memory!
