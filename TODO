- don't generate revision history in branch until really necessary
- custom implementation of last_revision() so that revision history doesn't
  have to be generated?
- avoid extra connect in logwalker?
- get rid of use of `svn ls' in logwalker
- more efficient implementation for applying txdeltas to weaves. perhaps convert svn deltas to bzr deltas?
