"""bzr-commitfromnews - make commit messages from the changes in a NEWS file.

commitfromnews is enabled by default when installed.

To use, just do a commit where the NEWS file for your project has a new section
added without providing a message to commit.

E.g.::
  $ echo "\n* new thing\n" >> NEWS
  $ bzr commit
  # editor pops open to let you tweak the message, and it starts with
    "* new thing" as the message to edit.

commitfromnews attempts to create a sensible default commit message by
including sections from a NEWS or ChangeLog file.
