Bzr revision metadata that doesn't exist in git:

 - revision ids
  * one-on-one mapping to git-sha's and revision properties
 - file ids
  * git-sha+path -> fileid mapping

refs/bzr/<revid> refs to be able to find Git revisions based on Bazaar revision
ids.

.bzr needs extra git metadata:

(for round-tripped revisions only)
 * global map from git sha's to bzr revision ids
  + generated by bzr-git (slow) when not present
 * per bzr-revision map from git sha to bzr file id, revision id
