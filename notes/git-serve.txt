Git serve

Todo:

 * Fix "bzr serve --git"

 * Fix the pack creation code in Dulwich. It doesn't generate deltas quite 
   well at the moment.

 * Switch to the new pack-based format once John's work on PackCollections 
   is finished. This should give very nice performance improvements.

 * Support roundtripping
