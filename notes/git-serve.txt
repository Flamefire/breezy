Git serve

Todo:

 * Fix "bzr serve --git"

 * Evaluate whether it's possible (in other words, whether the disk usage 
   is acceptable) to cache full Tree objects in .bzr/repository/git, 
   preferably using something that implements the VersionedFiles API.

 * Fix the pack creation code in Dulwich. It doesn't generate deltas quite 
   well at the moment.
