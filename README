This directory contains a simple plugin that adds 
Subversion branch support to Bazaar-ng (http://www.bazaar-ng.org/)

In order for this to work, you need to have the object oriented python 
bindings for Subversion installed (see http://pysvn.tigris.org/).

You will need a modified version of bzr that has support for 
foreign branches (branch at http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/foreignbranch)

Simply place this directory in ~/.bazaar/plugins and you should be able 
to check out branches from Subversion using bzr.
