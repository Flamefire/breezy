This is a plugin to implement post commmit emails for bzr.
This should eventually automatically activate if an email
address is set, and should allow format specifiers too.

Until then, it is activated by setting 
post_commit=bzrlib.plugins.email.post_commit in bazaar.conf or locations.conf.
The plugin must be installed as "email" (i.e. ~/.bazaar/plugins/email/).

The address to sent to is read from 'post_commit_to' and the address to send
from from 'post_commit_sender'.

If 'post_commit_url' is set, it is used instead of the branch URL
(useful since in most cases, you commit to a private url, and you want
the public HTTP url in the commit message).
