This is a plugin to implement 'switch' for bzr.
Switch needs to:
 * Be able to determine the path a branch should be pushed to.
   (bzr publish)
 * Trigger a push if a branch is out of date. (uses bzrtools).
 * Be able to pull down a new branches revisions. (uses standard pull).
 * Be able to replace the revision history of this branch with
   working_tree.pull(that_branch, clobber=True)
