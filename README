This directory contains a simple plugin that adds 
Subversion branch support to Bazaar (http://www.bazaar-vcs.org/)

You will need a modified version of bzr that has support for 
foreign branches (branch at http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/foreignbranch).

You also need the Subversion bindings for python.

Simply place this directory in ~/.bazaar/plugins and you should be able 
to check out branches from Subversion using bzr.
