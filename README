Bazaar Upload
=============

Overview
--------

bzr-upload is a plugin for Bazaar which lets you upload your working tree to
a remote location using ftp/sftp.

The main target audience is web developers who keep their web pages version
controlled with bzr.

Quickstart
----------

To get started, it's as simple as running::

    bzr upload sftp://user@host/location/on/webserver

This will initially upload the whole working tree, and leave a file on the
remote location indicating the last revision that was uploaded, in order to 
avoid uploading unnecessary information the next time.

If you would like to upload a specific revision, you just do:

    bzr upload -r X  sftp://user@host/location/on/webserver

bzr-upload, just as bzr does, will remember the location where you upload the 
first time, so you don't need to specify it every time.

If you need to re-upload the whole working tree for some reason, you can:

    bzr upload --full sftp://user@host/location/on/webserver



Collaborating
-------------

While we don't have any platform setup, you can branch from trunk:

    bzr branch lp:bzr-upload

And change anything you'd like, and get in touch with any of the authors to 
review and add the changes.

 * Symlinks are not supported
