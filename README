This directory contains a simple plugin that adds 
Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/) branch support to 
Bazaar (http://www.bazaar-vcs.org/)

You will need a recent version of Bazaar-NG, at least 0.8 (or 
one of the 0.8 pre releases).

You also need the Subversion bindings for python, with my patch for svn_info_t,
which has been in Subversions' repository since r19413.

Simply place this directory in ~/.bazaar/plugins and you should be able 
to check out branches from Subversion using bzr.
