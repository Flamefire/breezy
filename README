bzr-git, a plugin for bzr that adds git support.

This is (c) 2006-2008 Canonical Limited, and licenced under the GNU GPL 
Version 2 or later.  Please see COPYING for the full text of the licence.

This was originally written as a proof of concept at Europython 2006 by 
Robert Collins, using stgit's convenience methods for accessing gits head 
and parsing git output. Later, it was adapted to use James Westby's Python 
Git module (which had by then be renamed to "Dulwich") by Jelmer Vernooij.

Please see INSTALL for installation instructions, and TODO for future plans.
