Bazaar Upload
=============

Overview
--------

bzr-upload is a plugin for Bazaar which lets you upload your working tree to
a remote location using ftp/sftp.

The main target audience is web developers who keep their web pages version
controlled with bzr.

Quickstart
----------

To get started, it's as simple as running::

    bzr upload sftp://user@host/location/on/webserver

This will initially upload the whole working tree, and leave a file on the
remote location indicating the last revision that was uploaded
(.bzr-upload.revid), in order to avoid uploading unnecessary information the
next time.

If you would like to upload a specific revision, you just do:

    bzr upload -r X  sftp://user@host/location/on/webserver

bzr-upload, just as bzr does, will remember the location where you upload the 
first time, so you don't need to specify it every time.

If you need to re-upload the whole working tree for some reason, you can:

    bzr upload --full sftp://user@host/location/on/webserver

This command only works on the revision beening uploaded is a decendent of the
revision that was previously uploaded, and that they are hence from branches
that have not diverged. Branches are considered diverged if the destination
branch's most recent commit is one that has not been merged (directly or
indirectly) by the source branch.

If branches have diverged, you can use 'bzr upload --overwrite' to replace
the other branch completely, discarding its unmerged changes.


Automatically Uploading
-----------------------

bzr-upload comes with a hook that can be used to trigger an upload whenever
the tip of the branch changes, including on commit, push, uncommit etc. This
would allow you to keep the code on the target up to date automatically.

The easiest way to enable this is to run upload with the --auto option.

     bzr upload --auto

will enable the hook for this branch. If you were to do a commit in this branch
now you would see it trigger the upload automatically.

If you wish to disable this for a branch again then you can use the --no-auto
option.

     bzr upload --no-auto

will disable the feature for that branch.

Since the auto hook is triggered automatically, you can't use the --quiet
option available for the upload command. Instead, you can set the
'upload_auto_quiet' configuration variable to True or False in either
bazaar.conf, locations.conf or branch.conf.


Storing the '.bzr-upload.revid' file
------------------------------------

The only bzr-related info uploaded with the working tree is the corresponding
revision id. The uploaded working tree is not linked to any other bzr data.

If the layout of your remote server is such that you can't write in the
root directory but only in the directories inside that root, you will need
to use the 'upload_revid_location' configuration variable to specify the
relative path to be used. That configuration variable can be specified in
locations.conf or branch.conf.

For example, given the following layout:

  Project/
    private/
    public/

you may have write access in 'private' and 'public' but in 'Project'
itself. In that case, you can add the following in your locations.conf or
branch.conf file:

  upload_revid_location = private/.bzr-upload.revid


Upload from Remote Location
---------------------------

It is possible to upload to a remote location from another remote location by
specifying it with the --directory option:

    bzr upload ftp://public.example.com --directory sftp://private.example.com 

This, together with --auto, can be used to upload when you push to your
central branch, rather than when you commit to your local branch.

Note that you will consume more bandwith this way than uploading from a local
branch.

Ignoring certain files
-----------------------

If you want to version a file, but not upload it, you can create a file called
.bzrignore-upload, which works in the same way as the regular .bzrignore file,
but only applies to bzr-upload.


Collaborating
-------------

While we don't have any platform setup, you can branch from trunk:

    bzr branch lp:bzr-upload

And change anything you'd like, and file a merge proposal on Launchpad.


Known Issues
------------

 * Symlinks are not supported
