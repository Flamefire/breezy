This is a plugin to implement post commmit emails for bzr.
This should eventually allow format specifiers.

The plugin is activated by installing it (check it out to
~/.bazaar/plugins/email - 'ls ~/.bazaar/plugins/email/__init__.py' should list
a file), and then configure an address to send to as listed below.

NB: If you are using a bzr release from before 0.15, you need to manually tell
bzr about the commit action, by setting
post_commit=bzrlib.plugins.email.post_commit in bazaar.conf or locations.conf.

The address to sent to is read from 'post_commit_to' and the address to send
from from 'post_commit_sender'.

If 'post_commit_url' is set, it is used instead of the branch URL
(useful since in most cases, you commit to a private url, and you want
the public HTTP url in the commit message).

The option 'post_commit_mailer' can be used to override the name of
the mail program to use. It should behave like /bin/mail, at minimum
supporting the -s and -a options.

By default, the diff for the commit will be included in the email, if the
length is less than 1000 lines. This limit can be changed (for instance, to 0
to disable the feature) by setting the option 'post_commit_difflimit' to the
number of lines you wish it to be limited to.
