This is a plugin to implement post commmit emails for bzr.
This should eventually automatically activate if an email
address is set, and should allow format specifiers too.

Until then, it is activated by setting 
post_commit=bzrlib.plugins.email.post_commit in bazaar.conf or locations.conf.
The plugin must be installed as "email" (i.e. ~/.bazaar/plugins/email/).

The address to sent to is read from 'post_commit_to' and the address to send
from from 'post_commit_sender' (if not supplied defaults to standard bzr
'email').

If 'post_commit_url' is set, it is used instead of the branch URL
(useful since in most cases, you commit to a private url, and you want
the public HTTP url in the commit message).

The option 'post_commit_mailer' can be used to override the name of
the mail program to use. It should behave like /bin/mail, at minimum
supporting the -s and -a options.

Alternatively 'post_commit_mailer' can be set to 'smtplib' which will use
python's smtplib to send the email directly. If you use 'smtplib' you can also
configure the settings "smtp_server=host[:port]", "smtp_username=userid",
"smtp_password". If "smtp_username" is set but "smtp_password" is not, you
will be prompted for a password.

By default, the diff for the commit will be included in the email, if the
length is less than 1000 lines. This limit can be changed (for instance, to 0
to disable the feature) by setting the option 'post_commit_difflimit' to the
number of lines you wish it to be limited to.
