This is a plugin to implement post commmit emails for bzr.
This should eventually allow format specifiers.

The plugin is activated by installing it (check it out to
~/.bazaar/plugins/email - 'ls ~/.bazaar/plugins/email/__init__.py' should list
a file), and then configure an address to send to as listed below.

NB: If you are using a bzr release from before 0.15, you need to manually tell
bzr about the commit action, by setting
post_commit=bzrlib.plugins.email.post_commit in bazaar.conf or locations.conf.

The address to sent to is read from 'post_commit_to' and the address to send
from from 'post_commit_sender' (if not supplied defaults to standard bzr
'email').

If 'post_commit_url' is set, it is used instead of the branch URL
(useful since in most cases, you commit to a private url, and you want
the public HTTP url in the commit message).

The option 'post_commit_mailer' can be used to override the name of
the mail program to use. It should behave like /bin/mail, at minimum
supporting the -s and -a options.

Alternatively 'post_commit_mailer' can be set to 'smtplib' which will use
python's smtplib to send the email directly. If you use 'smtplib' you can also
configure the settings "smtp_server=host[:port]", "smtp_username=userid",
"smtp_password". If "smtp_username" is set but "smtp_password" is not, you
will be prompted for a password.
Also, if using 'smtplib', the messages will be sent as a UTF-8 text message,
with a 8-bit text diff attached (rather than all-as-one). Work has also been
done to make sure usernames do not have to be ascii.

By default, the diff for the commit will be included in the email, if the
length is less than 1000 lines. This limit can be changed (for instance, to 0
to disable the feature) by setting the option 'post_commit_difflimit' to the
number of lines you wish it to be limited to.
