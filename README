== Introduction ==

This directory contains a simple plugin that adds 
Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/) branch support to 
Bazaar (http://www.bazaar-vcs.org/)

== Dependencies == 

You will need at least version 0.9 of Bazaar-NG (currently unreleased).

You also need a fairly recent version of the Python bindings to the 
Subversion libraries. At the moment, the svn plugin only works with 
Subversion 1.5 (trunk). I plan to submit patches against the python-subversion 
package in Ubuntu Edgy later.

== Installation ==

Simply place this directory in ~/.bazaar/plugins and you should be able 
to check out branches from Subversion using bzr.

== License ==

GNU General Public License, v2 or later.

== Unit testing ==

Simply run 'bzr selftest svn'
