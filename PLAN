- svnpull
 - Maybe store latest known revision somewhere ?
 - walk over revno's and see if they already exist locally
  - if they don't, pull them in, use UUID-revno as revision
 - keep list of bzr revisions and to what SVN commit they belong
  - use revision properties (svn:revision) ?

- svnpush
 - for all local revisions that don't have svn:revision set:
  - send to remote server
  - set bzr:revision as SVN revision property
