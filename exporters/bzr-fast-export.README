bzr-fast-export is a front end for git-fast-import(1). It reads Bazaar
branches, and outputs a stream which git-fast-import wan convert into a
git repository.

Converting multiple related branches into a same git repository is
supported. You'll need to invoke bzr-fast-export once per branch, and
they'll "communicate" via mark files. See the docstring of the script
for a sample invocation.

Currently, "kind changes" are not supported (a kind change is when eg. a
directory becomes a file).

If you get a "Missing space after source" error from git-fast-import,
see the top of the script for a work-around.
