bzr 2.8b1
#########

:2.8b1: NOT RELEASED YET

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

.. These may require users to change the way they use Bazaar.

 * The ``bzr register-branch`` command from the Launchpad plugin has been
   removed, because it has not worked for at least five years: it relies on
   password authentication rather than SSO, the relevant systems no longer
   have firewall-level access to the outside world, and in general the
   Mirrored branch type is deprecated.  Either just push the branch to
   Launchpad or use code imports instead
   (https://help.launchpad.net/VcsImports).
   (Colin Watson, #254567, #483689)

New Features
************

.. New commands, options, etc that users may wish to try out.

Improvements
************

.. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance 
   or memory usage, or better results.

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where bzr would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

 * When generating documentation with a custom locale set, make sure
   doc/en/user-reference only contains English documentation.
   (Jelmer Vernooij, #1565503)

 * Fix for Windows and 32-bit platforms buggy gmtime().
   (Florent Gallaire, #1669178, #1670243)

Documentation
*************

.. Improved or updated documentation.

API Changes
***********

.. Changes that may require updates in plugins or other code that uses
   bzrlib.

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin 
   developers, but interesting for bzr developers.

Testing
*******

* POSIX mandates diff to exit with status 1 (was 2 previously), bzr didn't
  rely on that feature but one of the tests did.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #1622039)
