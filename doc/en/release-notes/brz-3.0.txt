brz 3.0.0
#########

:Codename: Pelican
:3.0.1: NOT RELEASED YET

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

 * The bzr command has been renamed to brz, to prevent
   clashes with upstream Bazaar.
   (Martin Packman, Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * The --prefix/-p argument for ``bzr diff`` now defaults to -p1 rather
   than -p0. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1695126)

 * The ``brz register-branch`` command from the Launchpad plugin has been
   removed, because it has not worked for at least five years: it relies on
   password authentication rather than SSO, the relevant systems no longer
   have firewall-level access to the outside world, and in general the
   Mirrored branch type is deprecated.  Either just push the branch to
   Launchpad or use code imports instead
   (https://help.launchpad.net/VcsImports).
   (Colin Watson, #254567, #483689)

 * brz no longer supports building the C extensions using Pyrex.
   Only Cython is supported. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Support for HTTP support using "pycurl" and the associated
   URL schemes "http+pycurl://" and "https+pycurl://" has been dropped.
   (Jelmer Vernooij, #82086, #377389, #122258, #516222, #545776, #1696602)

 * Support for medusa for FTP tests has been dropped, only
   pyftpdlib is now supported. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin 
   developers, but interesting for brz developers.

Testing

   which caused ``output_encoding = iso-8859-1`` to be added to the
   users' bazaar.conf. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
