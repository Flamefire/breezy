Custom Enhancements
===================

General
-------

The date format is auto-detected.


Parsing
-------

These enhancements over the specification are provided in order
to read data produced by git-fast-export:

* A person's name may be empty

* Long file modes with an extra leading 0, i.e. 0000644,
  0000755 and 0120000 are legal.
