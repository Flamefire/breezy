Way to propose branches for merging

How to find the proposer class?
 * is_compatible function for target branch
 * user can specify a proposer ("email-bundle", "launchpad", "github", ...) on
   the command-line or in config of the target branch

Need to find a way to automatically push up the local branch to the remote
system.

Allow "probing" rather than having to call is_compatible, and then construct a proposer.

Options:
 * Source branch (and their public copy) [X]
 * Target branch [X]
 * Prerequisite branch

 * Proposed commit message
 * Merge proposal text [X]
 * Suggested reviewers [X]
 * Bugs fixed

Later, or never:
 * way to list proposals
 * way to approve proposals
 * way to comment on proposals
