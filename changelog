  [ James Westby ]
  * debian/rules:
    + use '$(MAKE)' instead of 'make' to at least allow a parallel build.

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Sun, 09 Dec 2007 21:31:49 +0100

bzr (1.0~rc1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install images that come with the documentation.

  * Remove unnecessary stuff from the clean target in debian/rules, and
    invoke $(MAKE) clean-docs from there so that building twice in a row
    works.

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Sat, 01 Dec 2007 11:42:50 +0100

bzr (1.0~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Adeodato Simó ]
  * First release candidate of the upcoming 1.0 release; see NEWS.Debian for
    more information.

  [ Arnaud Fontaine ]
  * Rename XS-Vcs-Bzr to Vcs-Bzr field (dpkg supports it now).
  * Add Homepage field.
  * Update GPL path to GPL-2 as GPL-3 is now the default.

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Fri, 30 Nov 2007 15:43:46 +0100

bzr (0.92-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Final 0.92 release.
    - Introduction Packs as experimental format, which is expected to become
      the default format for the final release.            (Closes: #396227)

 -- Reinhard Tartler <siretart@tauware.de>  Tue, 13 Nov 2007 07:44:48 +0100

bzr (0.92~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release candidate for the upcoming 0.92 version.

  * Dropped Andres Salomon from the Uploaders field, at his request.

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Fri, 02 Nov 2007 22:29:16 +0100

bzr (0.91-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * remove python-celementree and python-paramiko from build-depends.
    rationale:
      - python-celementree is purely an optimisation for python2.4,
        and is already included in python2.5
      - python-paramiko is not used during build at all. However, the
        testsuite currently fails when paramiko is not installed
        (see also #59150 in launchpad.net for details). Since we
        currently don't run the testsuite by default on the buildds,
        it is safe to remove that dependency, at least for now.

 -- Reinhard Tartler <siretart@tauware.de>  Thu, 27 Sep 2007 12:25:43 +0200

bzr (0.91-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Final 0.91 release.

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Wed, 26 Sep 2007 22:16:47 +0200

bzr (0.91~rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Second release candidate for the upcoming 0.91 release.

  * Give a Files line in the HTML section of bzr.doc-base, since the doc-base
    package in etch requires it.

  * Suggest xdg-utils for /usr/bin/xdg-email, used if present in `bzr send`.

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Fri, 14 Sep 2007 10:02:29 +0200

bzr (0.90-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Final 0.90 upstream release:
    + the doc/ directory has been re-organized in subdirectories, thus
      separating between *.txt and *.html cannot be easily done from
      bzr.install anymore. Do it from debian/rules instead.
    + update bzr.doc-base for this new layout as well.

  * Ship documents under doc/developers, following upstream wishes.

  * Use "/usr/bin/python" in the she-bang line instead of "/usr/bin/env
    python". Rationale in LP: #134046 is right.

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Wed, 29 Aug 2007 12:29:26 +0200

bzr (0.90~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate:
    + drop no_python2.4_shebangs.diff, applied upstream.
    + adjust dont_build_developers_doc.diff.
    + HTML docs are now .html instead of .htm; adjust bzr.doc-base,
      bzr.install and rules accordingly.

  * The package now includes Pyrex extensions, so:
    + move Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends.
    + add python-all-dev to Build-Depends.
    + make the package arch:any.
    + add ${shlibs:Depends} to Depends.

  * Swap the order of the 'python (>> 2.5) | python-celementtree'
    build-dependency to make sbuild in the buildds happy. (Closes: #436396)

  * Pass --executable "/usr/bin/env python" to setup.py, to avoid spurious
    dependencies on python2.X.

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Wed, 15 Aug 2007 11:54:51 +0200

bzr (0.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

  * Drop version constraints in Build-Depends and Depends, all are satisfied
    in etch.

  * Add a patch to skip the generation of doc/developers/*.htm, since we don't
    ship those in the package.

  * debian/rules:
    + pass -r to xargs.
    + drop commented out install/bzr:: hunk.
    + don't abort the test suite on the first error.

  * Bits to help Ubuntu:

    + prefix dependency and build-dependency on python-celementtree with a
      "python (>> 2.5)" alternative, since Python 2.5 includes celementtree.

    + apply patch from Ubuntu to drop python2.4-specific shebang lines, and
      hence spurious dependency on python2.4 (submitted upstream).

    + drop build-dependency on python-medusa, only needed to exercise the FTP
      part of the test suite.

  * Delete man1/bzr.1 in clean, and delete all *.htm files under doc/ as well,
    not only the ones in the top-level dir.

  * Change Bazaar-NG to Bazaar in debian/bzr.doc-base.

  * Fix watch file to properly compare rc versions.

  * Add XS-VCS-Bzr header.

  * Bump debhelper compat to 5.
  * Comply with python policy mandated dependencies of debhelper and
    pycentral.
  * Flip DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS logic on the testsuite until someone figures out
    why it intermittently hangs under fakeroot.

bzr (0.11-1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * In test_osutils.py, sort what we get from os.listdir() before checking it;
    the OS can give back directory entries in whatever order it likes, and
    this shouldn't break the tests. Fixes intermittent test failures and
    FTBFS. (Closes: #395203)

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Wed,  8 Nov 2006 01:28:55 +0100

bzr (0.10~rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Second release candidate for the upcoming 0.10 version, fixes Launchpad
    #58057, `bzr selftest` only works from build tree.

  * Update download URL in debian/copyright.

  * Fix typo in previous changelog entry.

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Tue, 29 Aug 2006 03:49:33 +0200

bzr (0.10~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release candidate of the upcoming 0.10 version. Dropped patches,
    present upstream now (series file now empty):

    + bazaar.conf_is_file_not_dir.diff
    + bzr.dev.r1929_handle_TZ=UTC.diff

  * Changes in control fields:

    + add python-paramiko to Build-Depends, since now the test suite requires
      its presence.
    + change Build-Dependency on, er, python-all-dev, to python (>= 2.4).
    + bump version on python-central Build-Dependency-Indep to 0.5, and move
      it to Build-Depends; both suggested by lintian.

  * Dropped Lars Wirzenius from the Uploaders field, at his request. Thanks
    for the time you spent on the package, Lars!

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Mon, 28 Aug 2006 08:00:11 +0200

bzr (0.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Instead of setting TZ in debian/rules, appply patch from bzr.dev r1929 to
    handle TZ=UTC correctly. Thanks for the suggestion, Martin Pitt.

bzr (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bazaar 0.9 released and uploaded.

  * Fix download URL in debian/copyright (thanks, Etienne Goyer), add 2004 to
    the copyright statement, mention all co-maintainers and reformat the file
    a bit.

  * Create a stamp-doc after creating the HTML docs, so that it doesn't get
    invoked twice (once in build, and another time in binary).

  * Run test suite with TZ explicitly set to non-UTC from debian/rules, to
    workaround Launchpad #56290.

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Mon, 14 Aug 2006 19:52:23 +0200

bzr (0.9~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First 0.9 release candidate packaged (closes: #381920). Bugs reported in
    Debian's BTS fixed with this upload:

    + more informative error message when paramiko is not installed and an
      operation over SFTP is attempted.  (Closes: #370099)
    + progress bar and other output respect terminal width.  (Closes: #374674)
    + does not raise UnicodeEncodeError when launching an editor to enter
      commit message, and infotext is non-ASCII.  (Closes: #375405)

  * Patches updates:

    + move debian/001-bazaar.conf.patch to debian/patches, and use quilt to
      apply it (added build-dependency on it).
    + remove 003-unboundlocalerror.patch and 004-unboundlocalerror2.patch,
      included upstream.
    + drop 002-execute_path.patch, which is not needed anymore as per
      https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/bazaar-ng/2006q2/012247.html. Add a
      note to debian/TODO about preserving executable bits.

  * Move python-all-dev from Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends, well
    spotted by lintian.

  * Do not run `bzr selftest` if 'nocheck' is present in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.

  * Add python-medusa to Build-Depends-Indep to make the FTP tests runnable.

    docutils, paramiko, and celementtree.  (Closes: #376559, #363561)

  * Promote paramiko from Suggests to Recommends.  (Closes: #376837)

  * Update to new Python policy using pycentral.

  * Pass --no-plugins to `bzr selftest` in debian/rules.

  * Update Standards-Version to 3.7.2 (no changes needed).

  * Add myself as an uploader.

 -- Adeodato Simó <dato@net.com.org.es>  Mon, 24 Jul 2006 13:49:24 +0200

bzr (0.8.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

    (closes: #368760).

bzr (0.8.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set the tutorial as the Index page for doc-base (closes: #368120).
  * Add comments to the top of all patches in debian/ that describe upstream
    submission status.
  * Don't throw UnboundLocalError when attempting to write to a read-only
    repository; thanks to Martin F. Krafft and Bob Tanner (closes: #352707).
  * Don't throw UnboundLocalError on bzr ignore; thanks to
    Martin F. Krafft and Bob Tanner (closes: #352791).

 -- Andres Salomon <dilinger@debian.org>  Sat, 20 May 2006 03:34:32 +0000

bzr (0.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #366083).
  * No longer call bzr_man.py; upstream's install now automatically builds
    and installs the manpage.
  * Upstream cleaned up their docs, and reduced the number of them quite
    significantly (~30k vs. 300k).  There's not much point in bzr-doc anymore,
    so drop it and merge docs into the main package.  Conflict w/ the
    old bzr-doc package, too.
  * Include bzr.simple in /etc/bash_completion.d.
  * Add an entry to NEWS describing changes to how a user's email address
    is set, and point users at the (now correct) manpage (closes: #353540).
  * Don't install unit tests; this saves a few megs of code, and end users
    don't really need to be running this anyways (it's certainly not
    documented in end-user stuff).
  * Throw 002-execute_path.patch into debian/, as this is needed to shut
    lintian up (as originally done by Lars).
  * Misc additional lintian/linda changes/suggestions.
  * Don't create empty doc/text directory; create doc/txt instead
    (closes: #357254).

 -- Andres Salomon <dilinger@debian.org>  Fri, 19 May 2006 02:08:17 -0400

bzr (0.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adding myself to Uploaders with the agreement of Andreas and Jeff.
    Unfortunately, it seems that Rob is inaccessible right now.
  * bzrlib/uncommit.py, bzrlib/tests/test_weave.py: Removed #! line.
    This silences lintian, and the lines also didn't do anything
    useful since the files didn't have a main program so executing
    them was a no-op, basically.
  * doc/Makefile: Call rst2html, not rest2html.
  * debian/bzr-doc.linda-overrides: Added an override to silence linda
    about html-only-changelogs. This is actually a bug in linda, which
    will be filed, but until it's fixed, we still need to be quiet.
  * debian/control: Added python2.4-paramiko to Suggests for bzr.
    Closes: #352921.

bzr (0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Remove {build-,}deps on python, use python2.4 specifically
    (Closes: #334838).  Thanks, Bob Tanner.
  * Also explicitly build-dep on python2.4-docutils to try to avoid bringing
    in python 2.3 at all.  Sadly, python2.4-docutils Depends on
    python-docutils, which brings in python2.3-docutils and python2.3 anyway.

bzr (0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (Closes: #329950).
    + It now installs testsweet.py, so "bzr selftest" works (Closes: #331330).
    + This release uses a new weave-based tree format, and requires a "bzr
      upgrade" to continue working on old trees.
    + Incorporates patch so the man page can be built.
  * Add NEWS.Debian file detailing the above format change.
  * Run "./bzr selftest" as part of the package build, and bail if it fails.
  * Add new some new lintian overrides for non-executable-but-hash-banged
    .py files
  * debian/control fiddling:
    + Remove Recommends of urlgrabber, bzr doesn't use it anymore.
    + Convert Recommends of python2.4-celementtree to Depends.
    + Build-depend on python2.4-celementtree so it's used by the tests.
    + Remove Depends on regular elementtree.
  * Update debian/copyright with the FSF's new address.
  * Thanks to Jeff Bailey again.
