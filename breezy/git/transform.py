class GitTreeTransform(DiskTreeTransform):
    """Represent a tree transformation.

    This object is designed to support incremental generation of the transform,
    in any order.

    However, it gives optimum performance when parent directories are created
    before their contents.  The transform is then able to put child files
    directly in their parent directory, avoiding later renames.

    It is easy to produce malformed transforms, but they are generally
    harmless.  Attempting to apply a malformed transform will cause an
    exception to be raised before any modifications are made to the tree.

    Many kinds of malformed transforms can be corrected with the
    resolve_conflicts function.  The remaining ones indicate programming error,
    such as trying to create a file with no path.

    Two sets of file creation methods are supplied.  Convenience methods are:
     * new_file
     * new_directory
     * new_symlink

    These are composed of the low-level methods:
     * create_path
     * create_file or create_directory or create_symlink
     * version_file
     * set_executability

    Transform/Transaction ids
    -------------------------
    trans_ids are temporary ids assigned to all files involved in a transform.
    It's possible, even common, that not all files in the Tree have trans_ids.

    trans_ids are used because filenames and file_ids are not good enough
    identifiers; filenames change.

    trans_ids are only valid for the TreeTransform that generated them.

    Limbo
    -----
    Limbo is a temporary directory use to hold new versions of files.
    Files are added to limbo by create_file, create_directory, create_symlink,
    and their convenience variants (new_*).  Files may be removed from limbo
    using cancel_creation.  Files are renamed from limbo into their final
    location as part of TreeTransform.apply

    Limbo must be cleaned up, by either calling TreeTransform.apply or
    calling TreeTransform.finalize.

    Files are placed into limbo inside their parent directories, where
    possible.  This reduces subsequent renames, and makes operations involving
    lots of files faster.  This optimization is only possible if the parent
    directory is created *before* creating any of its children, so avoid
    creating children before parents, where possible.

    Pending-deletion
    ----------------
    This temporary directory is used by _FileMover for storing files that are
    about to be deleted.  In case of rollback, the files will be restored.
    FileMover does not delete files until it is sure that a rollback will not
    happen.
