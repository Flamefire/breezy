You need the Dulwich Python module installed (or in PYTHONPATH) and a fairly 
recent version of bzr.

You will also need either the python tdb or sqlite bindings; the latter are included
with Python.

For more information on Dulwich, see http://samba.org/~jelmer/dulwich/

Installing bzr-git can be done by putting it into the ~/.bazaar/plugins 
directory, and renaming its directory to "git".
