 FEATURES

  * "bzr commit" in git working trees works.

0.3.1	2009-05-13

 FEATURES

  * Alternative (faster) storage for SHA map using the TDB library
    (http://tdb.samba.org/). This will automatically be used if you have

	(slower) Sqlite database format will be used.

  * Now warns when escaping XML-invalid characters to work around a bug in the
    Bazaar revision serializer.

  * Now allows "unusual" file modes (100664, etc) but will warn the user about
    them.

 BUG FIXES

  * Fixed git-import.

  * Fixed handling kind changes (tree -> blob) during fetch.

0.3.0	2009-05-10

 FEATURES

  * Support parsing .gitignore

  * Support dpushing to remote repositories.
