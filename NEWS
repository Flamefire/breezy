    unknown characters. (#529460, Jelmer Vernooij)

 BUG FIXES

  * Fix warning about unclosed files on Windows. (#441978, INADA Naoki)

 PERFORMANCE

  * Improve performance of WorkingTree.extras() by not looking up the

    and revision trees. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    for repositories with a large number of revisions or big trees.
    (#486076, Jelmer Vernooij

 FEATURES

  * Support for parsing --HG-- metadata in git commit messages, for 
    better interoperability with bzr-hg.

  * Submodules are now imported. This requires the use of the 
    development-subtree format in bzrlib though. (#402814, Jelmer Vernooij)

0.4.2	2009-10-01

  * Cope with ghosts a bit better during "bzr dpush".
    (Jelmer Vernooij)

	(Jelmer Vernooij, Lukas Lalinsky)

 PERFORMANCE

  * Avoid re-fetching basis inventory during fetch.
    (Jelmer Vernooij)

0.4.1	2009-07-24

  * Avoid "No such revision" error when encountering submodules.
   (#400598)

0.4.0	2009-06-18

 BUG FIXES

  * Fix handling of not-executable files becoming executable without any 
    other changes. (#382609)

  * XML-invalid characters are now no longer squashed if not required by 
    the target repository serializer format. The only non-XML based format 
	at the moment is the "2a" development format supported since bzr 1.16.

  * Unusual file modes that could be created in Git repositories using older
    versions of Git are now stored in Bazaar revision properties. This means 
	it's now possible to import the Git repository and the Linux kernel repository.

  * Mark as compatible with bzr 1.16.

0.3.2	2009-05-20

 FEATURES

  * "bzr commit" in git working trees works to some extent.

0.3.1	2009-05-13

 FEATURES

  * Alternative (faster) storage for SHA map using the TDB library
    (http://tdb.samba.org/). This will automatically be used if you have 
	TDB and its Python bindings installed. In all other situations the previous
	(slower) Sqlite database format will be used.

  * Now warns when escaping XML-invalid characters to work around a bug in the
    Bazaar revision serializer.

  * Now allows "unusual" file modes (100664, etc) but will warn the user about
    them.

 BUG FIXES

  * Fixed git-import.

  * Fixed handling kind changes (tree -> blob) during fetch.

0.3.0	2009-05-10

 FEATURES

  * Support parsing .gitignore

  * Support dpushing to remote repositories.
