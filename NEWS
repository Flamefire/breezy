bzr-fastimport Release Notes
----------------------------

.. contents::

IN DEVELOPMENT
--------------

  COMPATIBILITY BREAKS:

    * The ``--inv-fulltext`` option is no longer supported. It was
      only used in experimental mode for old versions of bzrlib so
      it added more complexity than value. (Ian Clatworthy)

  FEATURES:

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr fast-import-info`` now handles an unlimited # of parents for a
      revision. The spec suggests the maximum ought to be 16 but the linux
      kernel has revisions with more than that.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Tag commands with a missing from clause now produce a warning but
      are otherwise ignored. (Scott James Remnant, Ian Clatworthy)

    * The fastimport-id-map file can now have more revisions than the
      repository. (Scott James Remnant)

    * Updated the bundled version of hg-fast-export to be the latest
      code from http://repo.or.cz/w/fast-export.git. It should now
      support recent Mercurial releases.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #318903)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix ``os`` import as needed on Windows.
      (Ian Clatworthy, esskov, #264988)

    * Handle a directory turning into a file and then the children
      of that directory being deleted.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #309486)

    * Handle an empty email section.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Handle multiple merges within the one merge clause. That's illegal
      according to the spec but git-fast-export does it.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #259711)

    * Handle names and paths that aren't utf8 encoded. The spec recommends
      utf8 encoding of these but git-fast-export doesn't always do that.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #289088)

    * Ignore lightweight tags with no from clause rather than abort.
      (It seems git-fast-export outputs these commands frequently now
      while it didn't appear to in early versions.)
      (Ian Clatworthy, edice, #259711)

    * Import into rich-root (and subtree) repositories without aborting.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #300921)

      (Alexey Stukalov)

      (Jelmer Vernooij)

0.6 23-Jul-2008
---------------

  FEATURES:

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Added NEWS containing Release Notes. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * ``bzr help fastimport`` now provides help that is useful.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Numerous fixes to ``bzr-fast-export.py`` to improve round-tripping
      with Git. Added ``--import-marks`` and ``--export-marks`` options
      to ``fast-import`` as well.
      (Pieter de Bie)

    * ``svn-fast-export.py`` now supports a regular-expression to specify
      the branches to export.
      (Mirko Friedenhagen)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Support the new Repository API added in bzr.dev r3510. The old API
      will be used for earlier versions of bzr including bzr 1.6beta2 and
      earlier. (Ian Clatworthy)

  COMPATIBILITY BREAKS:

    * The ``--inv-fulltext`` option is not yet supported when the new
      Repository API is used to import revisions. The option can be
      provided but it will be ignored. (Ian Clatworthy)

  API BREAKS:

    * The ``RevisionLoader`` class has been renamed to ``RevisionLoader1``.
      The ``ExperimentalRevisionLoader`` class has been renamed to
      ``ImportRevisionLoader1``. New classes called ``RevisionLoader2``
      and ``ImportRevisionLoader2`` are provided that use the new
      Repository API. (Ian Clatworthy)

  TESTING:

  INTERNALS:

    * Improved packaging by adding a setup.py file. (Ian Clatworthy)
