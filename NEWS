bzr (1.0~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of Bazaar changes the default format used for newly created
  branches and repositories. This format is understood by Bazaar 0.92 and
  later; previous versions won't be able to read this format. To create new
  branches while maintaining compatibility with previous Bazaar versions,
  pass --dirstate or --dirstate-tags (>= 0.15) to `bzr init`.

  To upgrade existing branches or repositories to this new format, run `bzr
  upgrade`, and then `bzr reconcile`. You need to run these two commands in
  each standalone branch (those that are not inside a shared repository), but
  only once in the toplevel directory for shared repositories.

  Additionally, you can run `bzr upgrade` in branches inside a shared
  repository to upgrade them to a format that support tags, introduced in
  version 0.15.

bzr (0.16~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This release changes the behaviour of `bzr remove/rm` to remove the working
  file if it could be recovered again. If you prefer keeping the file instead,
  issue the --keep option to rm and/or consider using an alias that always
  sets it (see /usr/share/doc/bzr/txt/using_aliases.txt) If it so happens that
  a file gets unexpectedly deleted, use `bzr revert <file>` to get it back.

bzr (0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Versions of bzr prior to 0.7 had users setting their email address in
  ~/.bzr.conf/email.  This has changed; email addresses are now set either via
  environment variables ($BZREMAIL or $EMAIL) or through the config file
  ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf.  See the bzr(1) man page for more details.

bzr (0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This release updates the bzr tree-format, and old trees will not be usable
  until they are upgraded with "bzr upgrade".  This should proceed smoothly,
  but the old .bzr dir is backed up to .bzr.backup should anything go wrong.
